# DOM

DOM stands for document Object Model.

## Just like Objects, the document object has

- Properties - They describe the characteristics of a web page (such as titile of the page)

- Methods - Perform a partucular task using properties of the object

- Events - Triggered whwen the user interacts with the computer

## How a browser sees a web page

1. Receive a page as a HMTL CODE - A website is seen a document or a collection of doccuments if
   it contains more than one page.

2. Create a model of the page and stores it in memory -

Structures the document object at the top and represents the tree like structure using the nodes that
represent the elements and the attribute.

3. Use a rendering engine to show the page on the screen.

Provides a default syling if it doies not find any CSS code. But when it does find a CSS code,
the rendering engine applys the CSS rules to get the right colors, fonts and layout.

**NOTE** All browsers have a javascript interpreter called the "scripting engine" that takes the
javascript code and interpretes it into instructions that the computer can understand. Each line of code
is ranslated one-by one by the interpreter.
